So today I decided to work with Chris on some E17 code for adding context sensitive menus to E17’s file manager, EFM. I think we’ll be done with this by the end of the day with a working rigth click -> Set As Wallpaper for Edje background files.
UPDATE:
And that code is in CVS and working right now. Its applied for Edje files (backgrounds and themes) right  now. The plan is to have an E17 module that allows the user to associate any mime / glob with a script / app on the system.
