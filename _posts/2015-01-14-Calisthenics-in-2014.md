title: Calisthenics in 2014

Towards the start of 2014, [Wendy](https://twitter.com/noodlycious) introduced me to calisthenics and body weight training. We started watching videos, mainly by [Frank Medrano](https://www.youtube.com/user/nashmedina), and we were very impressed with what someone can do with their own bodyweight; especially when we found out he follows a strict vegan diet!

At the time I had been working out at the gym 4 to 6 times a week almost for the past 11 years. My workouts changed periodically yet they always were based on lifting weights in all sorts of shapes and in all sorts of ways. I always maintained a comfortable and healthy body fat percentage between 8% and 12% depending on the time of year. At 5'7" my weight always ranged between around 150 to 155 pounds unless I was trying to bulk up.

I have always considered myself as a fit and relatively strong individual; that is to say, I believed that my weight to strength ratio was respectable. I always believed that was the case until I decided to take a serious attempt at incorporating more advanced bodyweight training into my weight lifting routine. Regular pushups, pullups, and dips were not a problem; even with additional weight I performed them consistently well and in good form. Attempting to do moves like muscle-ups, archer pull ups, or handstand pushups proved very difficult if not impossible for the former two exercises. I definitely have some work to do; I kept telling myself.

Around the same time I had rewatched the movie Ninja Assassin; and I was impressed when he performed his press to handstand; [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryGoK1l4KBk). I had also learned that the actor performing that press trained for around a year in order to perform the move. There I was, 10+ years of training; able to bench press around double my body weight, and I was quite far from performing the calisthenics moves I was attempting and thought it impossible to perform such a press to handstand.

I was determined to take the next year and train as effectively as I could in order to a solid muscle-up; a comfortable handstand from and to a controlled tuck; and and L-Sit to a press to handstand, a la Ninja Assassin.

To make a year long story much shorter, I am able to perform these moves with a high degree of comfort and control a year later. I plan to write a few posts in the near future about my journey and what I learned in this life changing year. It was and still is a journey of self exploration, learning my true potential (which I am eagerly pushing every day), and understanding how body and mind develop together to make you a better you, the best you that you can be with every passing day.

Special thanks again to [Wendy](https://twitter.com/noodlycious) for opening this new and fantastic world to me and [Frank](https://www.youtube.com/user/nashmedina) for being my infinite source of inspiration, both with what he does and what he says.
