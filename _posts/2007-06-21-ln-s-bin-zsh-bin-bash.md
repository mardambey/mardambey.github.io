So I finally decided to give Zsh a try. I spent some time customizing my .zshrc, fixed the prompt, got everything the way I like it, and I must say, its pretty nifty. The auto-completion is very well done, and I certainly do prefer it over Bashâ€™s. If you havent taken the time to look into it yet, I suggest you do.
