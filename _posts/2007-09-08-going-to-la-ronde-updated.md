So I’m off to La Ronde today! I hear its a pretty cool place, more info when I get back! The plan is to finish up, and get an uber steak and meat meal from Schwartz’s! Mmm… (=

UPDATE:
Had a fantastic time there! The queues were quite long, but it was worth it. Schwartz’s steak was incredible!! Lots of good meat, fries were great, salad, pickle, uber leet! (=
