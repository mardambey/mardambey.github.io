So was it any good? Actually, yes, it was, it made a lot of a difference at work… IRC was not too bad, since I phased it back in over the last couple of days, but IM was a major time killer. So whats a good compromise? Log onto IM during those times of the day where there isn’t a very heavy work load, like lunch, and right close to 5PM when we have our daily scrumm meeting.
