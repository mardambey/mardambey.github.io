Why can’t most audio players (software and hardware) have a “repeat one” or “repeat selection” feature? I find myself, once and again, wanting to repeat a certain song over and over, either when working, or when I’m running or at the gym. The solution is usually to either place it in its own playlist or folder, or just keep hitting the back button every time its done. VLC has this feature, hey Audacious, wanna implement it? Rockbox too? You’ll sure as hell make my life easier and my listening experience more enjoyable.
