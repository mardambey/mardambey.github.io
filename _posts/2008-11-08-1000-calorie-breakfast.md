After a night of solid clubbing, Wendy and I went for some breakfast at L’Avenue. While we stood in line waiting to go in, we decided to pick up a couple of pieces of cake from Premier Moisson because we were told there would be a 15 minute wait. After we finally got in there, we took a quick glance at the menu and ended up ordering 3 servings of egg benedicts for a grand total of: 3 plates of fruit, 6 eggs served on bagels and buns and 3 bowls of potatoes. The entire thing was around $50 and about 1000 calories per person. I haven’t eaten anything since (its 8:34 PM now).
