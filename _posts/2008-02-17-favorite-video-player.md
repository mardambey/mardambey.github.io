So I was watching Lost (720p) yesterday on my PC, and that thing would drop frames like there’s no tomorrow. I started off trying it with Totem, then VLC, and then I got so upset with the quality of the playback, I installed and tried Mplayer. Wow… just wow… I used to use Mplayer on my laptop a year ago (on the FreeBSD install) but I haven’t tried it out since. Its amazing how well the playback quality was with almost no dropped frames at all. Tells you a thing or two about how different well written software is.
