So what’s up with people writing crap and grammatically incorrect status messages on their facebook profile? “John Doe is I want to eat something” for example… Is it so hard to write “John Doe is hungry…” instead? For God’s sake people, come on! Use that thick lump between your ears a bit more and write proper English sentences…

Oh, and what the hell is up with this news feed item “John Doe updated their profile. They is now looking for friendship”. Damn it… “They is”? What the hell?
