Another year goes by - not much for now - more later. Can I have a knife and dice myself up for everyone to have a bit of? (=

update:

It was a pretty cool day after all (= Started in the morning with spending some time with Sara and Nardeen, followed by some lunch, then Amir called me, we went down to this fancy schmancy gym, was good as well. At night, I had some dinner with the family, that was also really great, and later at night, I had some misc food items with Sara and Nardeen agian at Chilliâ€™s. Thank you everyone, and thanks to everyone who left comments on this news post. (=
