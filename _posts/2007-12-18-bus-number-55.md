This is one of the worst buses I have had to take in Montreal. I usually wait for it by the St. Laurent metro station, and boy what a wait. It gets worse every day. The latest trend is having the bus arrive only to have an “out of service” tag on it and it passes right by! Why would a bus pass on time, right by the queue of people, and have an out of service sign? As a matter of fact, I waited for around 35 minutes today. Both buses had an out of service sign, but the second one picked us up. I need to find a solution to all of this… -25 degrees and a 30 minute wait is not gonna cut it this winter.
