Just when the weather was starting to clear up, and just after enjoying a sunny weekend, I got into the metro this morning, got out, and SWOOSH! Another nice windy snowy day! There was no way I was going to walk up to work form the metro in that weather, so I just waited (for around 15 minutes might I add) for the bus. Just another day in Montreal. (=
