2015 was a life altering year for me. I embarked on new professional opportunities, changed my lifestyle drastically, and underwent some health set backs. With so much changing, I started to think about where my life was headed and what my next direction looked like. Although I am still learning and discovering, I know that there are a few things that I want, and others that I dont want.

# Wants
* Financial freedom and wealth
* Freedom of time
* Constantly be learning and sharing knowledge with others
* Healthy and high quality nutrition
* Mental health and acquity
* Experience life extraordinarily
* Love and happiness with family and friends

# Dont Wants
* Not to have to work for money all my life
* Any form of financial debt
* Spending my time and life doing things I do not believe in
* Sacrificing health and diet due to anything
* Be normal and average
